# PhD position Computational Genome Biology
PhD position in computational Genome Biology

Ph.D. Studentships in Computational Biology
Applications are invited from talented and passionate candidates to work on several next generation sequencing (NGS)-based research studies as well as proteomic studies and pursue their Ph.D. in Computational Biology at the Institute of Bioinformatics (IOB) in Bangalore (http://www.ibioinformatics.org). The selected candidates will be enrolled for their Ph.D. at Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), Manipal. The thrust areas of IOB include infectious diseases, neurological disorders, cancer biology and computational biology. The selected candidates will undergo excellent training in next generation sequencing methods as well as Big Data analysis with opportunity to work on data generated from next generation sequencing methods such as whole genome/exome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing and small RNA sequencing. IOB is also internationally known for mass spectrometry-based proteomics, which provides opportunities to work on multi-omics studies such as proteogenomics, metabolomics, pathways and interaction networks. 
Prerequisites:
Applicants of various backgrounds are welcome with majority of requirements are listed below
1.	M.Sc/M.Tech in Bioinformatics/ Biotechnology/ Genomics/ Medical Genetics/ Computer Science/ IT with good understanding Bioinformatics and Genomics
